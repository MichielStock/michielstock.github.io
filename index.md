# Maximum Entropy

Hi, I am Michiel Stock, a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University.
I am interested in applying computational intelligence to modelling and engineering in the life sciences.
During my PhD, I worked on kernel-based methods to model interactions.
Afterwards, I spend a couple of years on modelling species interaction networks.
Now, my main focus is on stochastical modelling and operations research for synthetic biology.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running, and boardgames. I am also following training to become a chef.
