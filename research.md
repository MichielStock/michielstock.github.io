# Research mission


I am co-leading the [KERMIT](https://kermit.ugent.be/index.php) research unit together with Bernard De Baets, where I am responsible for the computational modelling research line. KERMIT’s mission is to harness **mathematics** and **computation** to unravel life's complexities, optimize biological functions, and drive innovation in biodesign and decision-making under uncertainty. Focused on **applied biological sciences**—including biotechnology, environmental technology, plant breeding and food technology—, KERMIT refines existing methods and develops cutting-edge approaches across disciplines. The team is committed to creating **accessible software tools** that transform data streams into actionable and interpretable insights. Valuing continuous learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and mental well-being, KERMIT embraces a **holistic approach** to solving challenges in our data-driven, interconnected world.

In our subgroup, we specifically focus on non-conventional computing for understanding biological systems, including stochastic and differential programming, evolutionary computing, and other related approaches. Though we have an interest in various application fields within the applied biological sciences, we have plant growth and synthetic biology as our key focuses.
