<h1 id="the_joy_of_sketchnoting"><a href="#the_joy_of_sketchnoting" class="header-anchor">The joy of sketchnoting</a></h1>
<p>Since the summer of 2016, I try to frequently make <a href="http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/">sketchnotes</a>. Sketchnotes are the hipster way of taking notes. The idea is that you document meetings, presentations and the like using a combination of doodles, text and diagrams. That way you end up with a summary that is something a hybrid between a scheme and a comic book page.</p>
<p>Not only is making sketchnotes much more fun than traditional boring noting, it is in my opinion also much more effective&#33; When I am trying to make a simple and visually appealing record, I am much more actively processing the content. I generally make sketchnotes in the following situations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Live, during presentations.</strong> This is the most intense, as I have to distill the main ideas of the talk and find a good way to draw them in a very short time. Ideally, I also want to have a sketchnote that completely fills one or two pages. For this reason, I often draw a &#39;filler&#39; doodle during the Q&amp;A. The difficulty notwithstanding, some of my best sketchnotes are drawn during a talk. If I can convey the main message, it is usually an indication that the presenter gave a very lucid talk&#33;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>To summarize papers and books.</strong> Sketchnoting is an excellent way to retain information from books or papers. Since I always carry my notebook with me, I can rapidly look back to the main points of something I read. Since the sketches are often quite distinctive, I can quickly find back the relevant page.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>To organize my thoughts.</strong> When preparing a lecture or presentation, writing out a project proposal or brainstorming for new research ideas, I like to make a sketchnote as well. If I can outline the crux in a page or two, I can usually explain it well to other people. Since sketchnoting is quite visually stimulating, I also better remember the content.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I always thought of myself as being spectacularly bad at drawing. Being friends with <a href="http://www.koenvandeneeckhout.be/category/artwork/">Koen van den Eeckhout</a>, who is the official sketchnoter of the <a href="http://www.wetenschapscafe.be/">Science Caf√©</a> at Ghent, does <em>not</em> help my self esteem. The philosophy of sketchnoting however is to keep the artwork simple and having fun is more important than a crisp end result. Remember, there are only five basic shapes to draw just about anything: point, square, circle, line and triangle. Though I still do not find my drawings very appealing, I do see quite an improvement of my artwork in the last years.</p>

<p>Sketchnotes are an good way to have a bit of presence on the social media. Posting the notes on Twitter during a conference is a good way to meet some people and people will be grateful that you documents the talks for them&#33; I also find that tweeting sketchnotes of papers is a good way to signal what your research interests are&#33; And sometimes one of them gets picked up and results in a bunch of new followers&#33; Furthermore, if the chief storyteller of the Flemish news want to use your notes of the <a href="https://michielstock.github.io/Media-school/">media school</a> in his course, it is a huge ego-boost &#61;&#41;</p>
<p>P.S. Since this year I have taken up <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journalling</a> as well. I find that this is a good way to keep track of my work and what I read and it is another way to express my love for fancy notebooks.</p>
