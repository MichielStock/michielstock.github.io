# Teaching duties

Within the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, I am mainly involved in teaching the elementary modeling courses in the Bachelor of Bioscience Engineering. I stronly belief in the power of computation and toy systems to learn concepts. Students learn by being able to toy around in with concrete examples.

Concretely, I teach:
-  Lecturer in charge of Differential Equations (2nd Ba Bioscience Engineering) 2023-now 
    - A basic course on analytically and numerically solving ODEs, with an introduction to PDEs, series solutions and the Laplace transform.
- Lecturer in charge of Differential Equations (2nd Ba Biosciences) 2023-now 
    - The condensed course of Differential Equations for Biosciences.
- Lecturer in charge of Modelling and Simulation (2nd Ba Bioscience Engineering) 2024-now 
     - Here, we see the main principles of modelling and simulation with differential equations and probability distributions. We cover mass balances, SDEs, SSAs, Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Bayesian reasoning, optimization, calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty, model selection and more!
    - Check out our [course website](https://kermit-ugent.github.io/ModSim/).
- Lecturer in charge of Introduction to Modelling and Simulation (Ma Environmental Sanitation) 2024-now
    - An elementary introduction to ModSim, based on Alan Downey's book [Modeling and Simulation in Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ModSimPy/).

In addition, I used to teach Selected Topics in Mathematical Optimization (Ma Bioinformatics), which introduced various numerical algorithms for optimization. You can check out the material [here](https://michielstock.github.io/STMO/). 

Together with some friends, we give an annual three-day Doctoral School on the Julia language. You can check that out [here](https://beramos.github.io/DS-Julia2925/).
