In most cases, we don&#39;t really know how the parts interact and from a good design. The solution is to start from experiments or naturally occurring variants and see what we can learn from them.</p> <p>In my research, I mainly deal with either <em>combinatorial systems</em>, where the question is which building blocks to select and how to connect them, and <em>compositional systems</em>, where one wants to determine the relative quantities of the modules. An example of the former is when one wants to pick bacteria for a biodegrading co-culture, while the latter would involve the bacteria&#39;s initial relative abundances. Key to these problems is that one typically has some kind of description or similarity over the building block one wants to exploit.</p> <p><img src="../images/comb_comp.png" alt="Combinatorial and compositional problems." /></p> <p>Tackling these problems usually involve a combination of <em>learning</em>, <em>optimization</em> and <em>sampling</em>. Learning involves fitting predictive models to understand designs. Optimization allows us to develop the next best design to test, while sampling acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in biological systems. I am fond of methods that one can be implement in a few lines of code &#40;my PhD was about kernel methods&#41;. Most of the fun is discovering a new application or modification for an existing algorithm to find a wholly new use.</p> <p><img src="../images/methods_triangle.png" alt="Different methods of interest." /></p> <p>As part of the faculty of bioscience engineering, I work together with various people on applications in life science. My main interest is in community ecology, microbiomes and synthetic biology, though I always keep my eyes open for food-related ideas for hobby projects. Currently, I guide five PhD students. Two are working on methodological techniques; three are working on applications: <a href="https://ciliblog.github.io/">designer phages</a>, biofilm detection and microbiome engineering.</p> <p>In research, personal or when working with others, I value learning and trying new things, creativity and collaboration as key principles.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Michiel Stock.
