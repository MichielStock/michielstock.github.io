Downey</p> <p>related books: <a href="/posts/2023/2023-09-20-thinking_in_systems/">Thinking in Systems</a></p> <p><img src="https://greenteapress.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/modsimpy_cover.png" alt="" /></p> <h2 id=the_main_takeaway ><a href="#the_main_takeaway" class=header-anchor >The main takeaway</a></h2> <p>This book introduces the main concepts of modeling and simulation in a practical, hands-on, case study-based fashion using Jupyter notebooks. The author keeps the mathematics to the bare minimum &#40;it only requires a superficial knowledge of derivatives&#41; while having the applications area as broad as possible. It covers first-order differential equations &#40;growth&#41;, simple systems &#40;the SIR model and an insulin model&#41; and several second-order systems based on Newton&#39;s second law &#40;rolling toilet paper and throwing a baseball&#41;. Most examples are solved using custom ModSim software that uses a finite-step method. The author also introduces other tools, such as solving differential equations in Sympy and root-finding methods for optimization and parameter finding.</p> <h2 id=who_is_this_for ><a href="#who_is_this_for" class=header-anchor >Who is this for?</a></h2> <p>I found this book while researching how to develop a more practical version of the modeling course I teach &#40;that now only covers ODEs&#41;. This book is very introductory and likely won&#39;t appeal to those who have advanced mathematics courses at some point. However, for those who did not, it is a very accessible introduction to modeling that can immediately be used for a wide range of systems. The author also has a lot of notebooks online for the exercises.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Michiel Stock. Last modified: June 05, 2025.
