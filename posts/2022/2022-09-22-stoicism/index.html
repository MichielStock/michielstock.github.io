<h2 id="the_main_takeaway"><a href="#the_main_takeaway" class="header-anchor">The main takeaway</a></h2>
<p>The Little Book of Stoicism gives a practical and accessible introduction to stoicism. The first half covers the essential aspects of the stoic principles. To thrive &#40;reaching <em>Eudaimonia</em>&#41;:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>focus only on the aspects you can control;</p>
</li>
<li><p>take responsibility for your actions;</p>
</li>
<li><p>try to aim to be the very best of yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people have only a limited sphere of control. Most circumstances are outside our power to change. We can choose how to <em>react</em> to what happens around us. </p>
<p>The book&#39;s second half outlines more than 50 stoic practices and mindsets one can use to deal with daily hardships or be generally happier. They range from routines such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_visualization">negative visualisation</a>, voluntary discomfort and a stoic morning routine to mindsets such as considering everything being borrowed from nature, doing good and projecting kindness as strength.</p>
<h2 id="who_is_this_for"><a href="#who_is_this_for" class="header-anchor">Who is this for?</a></h2>
<p>Life is hardâ€”stoicism is a practical philosophy for becoming a more resilient, better, and generally happier person. Practising stoicism has helped me immensely with my mental well-being. This book is a very accessible introduction to getting started. It is chiefly a self-help book. For those who want a more formal, though still concise introduction, I can also strongly recommend &quot;Lessons on Stoicism&quot; by John Sellars.</p>
