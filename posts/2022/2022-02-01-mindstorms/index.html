Papert, an AI and education researcher at MIT, believes in using computers to create &quot;<em>microworlds</em>&quot; for teaching. These are tiny self-contained universes where children and students can explore a given concept, say geometry. Most of his case studies relate to experiences using the Logo programming language, which allows people to use simple, human-readable instructions to draw simple graphics, the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a>. Children are free to experiment, create, fail, and debug. The limited complexity serves as a safe haven for children to build confidence in their skills. I particularly liked one anecdote of a girl who initially had a lot of trouble writing programs. The instructor simplified her setup to boost her confidence, enabling her only to draw lines with fixed angles. After a couple of weeks of playing with the possibilities, she found herself suggesting more elegant ways to draw something than her instructor saw. The student became the master.</p> <p>Interestingly, Papert did not advocate learning children to work with computers because it helps solve practical problems. Instead, he valued programming because it improves how children <em>think</em> about problems. It motivates creativity, shows multiple ways to tackle a problem and forces students to identify and fix errors. </p> <h2 id=who_is_this_for ><a href="#who_is_this_for" class=header-anchor >Who is this for?</a></h2> <p>Mindstorms is a great inspiring book for teachers, not only for introducing children to programming but as a general case study in discovery-based learning. I even believe there is quite some wisdom for computational researchers as well.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Michiel Stock. Last modified: June 17, 2025.
