<h2 id="the_main_takeaway"><a href="#the_main_takeaway" class="header-anchor">The main takeaway</a></h2>
<p>Tony Fadell had a career to be envious of: hard- and software designer &#40;co-creator of the iPod and iPhone&#33;&#41;, entrepreneur and CEO &#40;founder of Nest, the company that made thermostats sexy&#41;, investor etc. Despite such a stellar track record, Fadell admits to making plenty of mistakes, just like the rest of us&#33; Any successful person likely has plenty of mentors before becoming a mentor themself. In <em>Build</em>, Fadell bundles what he considers his most important advice to build a fruitful career. It covers aspects from your first job to how to become a CEO.</p>
<p>The book is subdivided into six sections, each containing several small chapters with tidbits of practical advice. It covers</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Build yourself</strong>; where planning your first career should mainly be centred around what you want to <em>learn</em> rather than what you want to earn. Work hard, and work with established leads in your field of choice &#40;&quot;heroes&quot;&#41;. I prefer small companies or groups where you can make a difference.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build your career</strong> how to work in a group, why managing is a distinct skill and how to deal with various types of assholes. It also covers the etiquette of how and when to quit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build your product</strong>, good product design focuses on the customer. A successful product reveals and solves a problem your customer might not know they had &#40;&quot;painkillers are better than vitamins&quot;&#41;. Your product should have a story that appeals to people&#39;s emotional and rational side. Reaching profitability will always take longer than you think.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build your business</strong> is just as important as building the product&#33; A good business idea starts with the <em>why</em> &#40;one should care&#41;. It covers accepting venture capitalists, work-life balance and coping with a crisis;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build your team</strong> covers hiring, dealing with the growth of the company and the roles of sales, designers and lawyers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be the CEO</strong>; there can be several founders but only one CEO. You must deal with a board, buying and being bought while maintaining company culture. Fadell has some good views on perks &#40;no free massages&#33;&#41;, don&#39;t give regular free stuff that becomes an acquired right though the occasional surprise boosts morale. Not all founders have what it takes to become a CEO, and even for successful CEOs, there might be a natural point to step down when you cannot let your company grow anymore, and you&#39;ve effectively become a babysitter.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This book generally contains good advice for those planning a career in a technical field. Many aspects might also be relevant for an academic profile, e.g. building and managing a group.</p>
