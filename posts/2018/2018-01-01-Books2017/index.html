Luckily, I still found the time to digest some books.</p> <p>Reading books is not only one of my favorite pastimes, I find it vital to keep up with different scientific fields and to learn about new topics. Biographies give me inspiration from the lives of successful and interesting people and self-help books such as &#39;The Organized Mind&#39; give me practical tips to better do the things I want to do. I balance the usefulness of nonfiction with a healthy dose of novels and fantasy books&#33;</p> <p>These are the books I have read in 2017.</p> <h2 id=fiction ><a href="#fiction" class=header-anchor >Fiction</a></h2> <h3 id=novels ><a href="#novels" class=header-anchor >Novels</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>&#39;The Circle&#39; by Dave Eggers. In this novel we follow Mae, a young ambitious graduates who lands her dream job in the Circle in customer services. Though the story is simple, the satire is topical and the book is worth a read. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#39; by Neil Gaiman. Simple, but hauntingly beautiful story. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;Memoirs of a Polar Bear&#39; by Yōko Tawada. Strange book written from the perspectives of three generations of polar bears. Did not like it as much as I thought I would. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;The Story of My Teeth&#39; by Valeria Luiselli. The story of a charlatan. Funny at some moments, but seemed to satire some aspects of literature I am not so familiar with. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;Call Me By My Name&#39; by André Aciman. Got this one nearly ten years ago for Christmas and finally got around reading it. A beautiful love story between two young men. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;Hag-Seed: The Tempest Retold&#39; by</p> </ul> <p>Margaret Atwood. First work of Margaret Atwood I ever read. Funny and engaging, though the middle and ending became a bit tiresome. Will definitely read other work of this renowned author&#33; &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <h3 id=fantasy_and_science_fiction ><a href="#fantasy_and_science_fiction" class=header-anchor >Fantasy and Science Fiction</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>&#39;Sleeping Giants &#40;Themis Files, #1&#41;&#39; by Sylvain Neuvel.

Well-written fantasy on society and identity. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;Warbreaker&#39; by Brandon Sanderson. Sanderson is known for his highly enjoyable fantasy novels with interesting magic systems. This one did not disappoint. Though I read it with much pleasure, Sanderson his novels do feel a bit formalistic after a while. &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41;</p> <li><p>&#39;The Once and Future King&#39; by T.H. White.
